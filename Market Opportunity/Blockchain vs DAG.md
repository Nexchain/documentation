## ðŸ’ª Blockchain vs DAG
A [Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-dag-and-blockchain/) is a data structure used as an alternative to traditional blockchain architectures to improve scalability and transaction throughput. Unlike conventional blockchains that organize transactions into sequential blocks, a DAG arranges transactions in a web-like structure, allowing them to be confirmed asynchronously.

A DAG is characterized by its directed nature, meaning [transactions flow in a single direction](https://tokenminds.co/blog/knowledge-base/what-is-a-directed-acyclic-graph), from past to future. It is also acyclic, ensuring that no loops or cycles exist, which prevents transactions from referencing themselves. Instead of using blocks, transactions in a DAG reference multiple prior transactions, forming an interwoven structure that facilitates rapid validation.

This structure allows DAGs to support parallel transaction processing, whereas traditional blockchains must validate blocks sequentially. The absence of fixed block sizes eliminates bottlenecks, resulting in significantly higher throughput. [Without the need for miners or validators](https://sdlccorp.com/directed-acyclic-graphs-dags-and-their-impact-on-transaction-fees/) in the traditional sense, transaction fees are reduced, making DAG-based networks more cost-effective. Moreover, because DAGs do not rely on energy-intensive Proof-of-Work mechanisms, they consume significantly less power, improving efficiency and sustainability.

Scalability is another advantage of DAGs, as their [architecture enables networks to handle a higher volume of transactions without congestion](https://crustlab.com/blog/dag-vs-blockchain/#:~:text=DAGs%20inherently%20offer%20higher%20scalability,more%20transactions%20without%20compromising%20speed). Unlike blockchains that require all participants to agree on the validity of entire blocks, DAG systems distribute validation across the network dynamically. As a result, transaction finalization times are reduced, and network performance remains stable even as usage increases.

Several blockchain projects have adopted DAG-based architectures. [IOTA](https://sdlccorp.com/post/top-cryptocurrencies-using-dag-technology/), for example, uses a system called "Tangle" to facilitate feeless microtransactions, particularly for IoT applications. Nano employs a similar approach to optimize peer-to-peer transactions, while [Avalanche](https://www.techrxiv.org/users/879475/articles/1258689-avalanche-a-secure-peer-to-peer-payment-system-using-snowball-consensus-protocols) incorporates DAGs within its consensus mechanism to enhance efficiency.

Nexchain integrates DAGs to improve scalability by enabling parallel transaction execution. This reduces network congestion and supports low-cost, high-speed processing. The system also leverages AI-driven optimizations to maintain security and reliability, ensuring that transactions are validated efficiently while preserving decentralization.
